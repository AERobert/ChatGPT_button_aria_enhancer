# HearChat: Accessible and Enhanced ChatGPT

A Chrome extension to make ChatGPT more accessible and friendly for screen reader users.

### Features

1. automatically Adds headings to the ChatGPT assistant name for easier navigation.
- works with all GPTs, along with old, and shared chats.
- Allows the user to set their preferred heading level, or to turn the feature off if they prefer.

2. Sound effects to indicate when ChatGPT starts and stops responding
- Provides 25 sound effects to choose from to make all the notifications unique.

- Screen reader announcements when ChatGPT starts/stops
- Ability to change the announcement messages in the options page.

4. Labels most unlabeled buttons in the interface using helpful aria-labels

5. Adds several keyboard shortcuts to make navigating ChatGPT faster.

6. Includes an option to speak each response automatically using OpenAI's speech synthesizer.

7. Includes various other accessibility fixes to the interface.

8. As referenced above, provides an options page to customize the behavior of the extension and its features.

### To do

1. Add more options for sound effects, and ability for users to upload their own.
2. Try to improve the accessibility of the GPT Store's search feature.
3. A few buttons and popups still don't have labels.
4. Add ability to speak each response and announcement using the Web Speech API (which would allow much more control compared to OpenAI's synthesizer).
5. Port the extension to other browsers, like Firefox and Safari.
